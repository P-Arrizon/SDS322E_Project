## Project Description
  Our goal is to create a model that can give us the likelihood of a possible heart complication. 

## Data
  Our data can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction)
  
  The data has 918 observations of the 12 following variables:
  
1. Sex: sex of the patient [M: Male, F: Female]

2. ChestPainType: chest pain type [TA: Typical Angina, ATA: Atypical Angina, NAP: Non-Anginal Pain, ASY: Asymptomatic]

3. RestingBP: resting blood pressure [mm Hg]

4. Cholesterol: serum cholesterol [mm/dl]

5. FastingBS: fasting blood sugar [1: if FastingBS > 120 mg/dl, 0: otherwise]

6. RestingECG: resting electrocardiogram results [Normal: Normal, ST: having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV), LVH: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria]

7. MaxHR: maximum heart rate achieved [Numeric value between 60 and 202]

8. ExerciseAngina: exercise-induced angina [Y: Yes, N: No]

9. Oldpeak: oldpeak = ST [Numeric value measured in depression]

10. ST_Slope: the slope of the peak exercise ST segment [Up: upsloping, Flat: flat, Down: downsloping]

11. HeartDisease: Binary variable, states if the subject experienced heart disease [1: heart disease, 0: Normal]
