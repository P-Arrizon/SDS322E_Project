## Project Description
  Our goal is to create a model that can give us the likelihood of a possible heart complication. 

## Data
  Our data can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction)
  
  The data has 918 observations of the 12 following variables:
  
Sex: sex of the patient [M: Male, F: Female]

ChestPainType: chest pain type [TA: Typical Angina, ATA: Atypical Angina, NAP: Non-Anginal Pain, ASY: Asymptomatic]

RestingBP: resting blood pressure [mm Hg]

Cholesterol: serum cholesterol [mm/dl]

FastingBS: fasting blood sugar [1: if FastingBS > 120 mg/dl, 0: otherwise]

RestingECG: resting electrocardiogram results [Normal: Normal, ST: having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV), LVH: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria]

MaxHR: maximum heart rate achieved [Numeric value between 60 and 202]

ExerciseAngina: exercise-induced angina [Y: Yes, N: No]

Oldpeak: oldpeak = ST [Numeric value measured in depression]

ST_Slope: the slope of the peak exercise ST segment [Up: upsloping, Flat: flat, Down: downsloping]

HeartDisease: Binary variable, states if the subject experienced heart disease [1: heart disease, 0: Normal]
